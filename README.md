There were 843,416 trips taken in July 2013, 1,001,958 trips taken in August 2013, 1,034,359 trips taken in September 2013. The trip numbers have increased after the summer in 2013.
There was a 50-50 breakdown of Customers/Subscribers by total numbers from August to September 2013, with about 5,500 Customers and 5,500 Subscribers per month. This indicates the importance of marketing
campaign aimed at BOTH segments - Customers and Subscribers.
In August 2013, the peak time for bikes is 12PM through end of day, while in September the peak time is 6AM. The indication here is that, during the fall, people are riding bikes to work. During
the summer, people are riding bikes for leisure potentially. Further analysis would be required on this point, but the trend is consistent on a day-to-day basis indicating
that there is indeed some indicator that summer bike peak hours start later than fall peak hours.
In September 2013, it is evident that, per station a total of 4K drivers started. This information is depicted in Sheet "Top 10 Stations Start Journey." The end spot is in locations
throughout the midtown/uptown area, indicating that bikes are traveling to midtown and uptown. 
There are also starting locations in "Bottom 10 for Starting Journey." As a new data analyst working with the management team, I would want to focus on increasing the bike ridership
in these locations, realizing that these "Bottom 10 for Starting Journey" are contributing to market share for total bike ridership. I would want to work on improving customer experience
and advertising to gain new customers for these stations. 
In summary, trip numbers increase from August 2013 to September 2013, and emphasis should be placed on advertising in all three of these months. Customers and Subscribers are important, although
Customers travel more per trip and Subscribers travel more overall in total. In summer, leisure places can be used to advertise the bikes for people looking to travel from downtown to midtown,
whereas in fall, work locations can be a focus point and the traffic start to already peak early in the AM, so the business should be set up for success from those hours.
